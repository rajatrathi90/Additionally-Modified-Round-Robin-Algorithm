# Additionally-Modified-Round-Robin-Algorithm
The aim of the project is to propose a modified version round robinalgorithm which will perform superior than current round robin algorithm and in most cases better than other algorithms as well in terms of minimizing average waiting time, average turnaround time and number of context switches.
